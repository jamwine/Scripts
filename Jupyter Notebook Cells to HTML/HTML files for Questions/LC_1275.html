<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-winner-on-a-tic-tac-toe-game/">1275. Find Winner on a Tic Tac Toe Game</a></h2>

<pre><code>Tic-tac-toe is played by two players A and B on a 3 x 3 grid. The rules of Tic-Tac-Toe are:

Players take turns placing characters into empty squares ' '.
The first player A always places 'X' characters, while the second player B always places 'O' characters.
'X' and 'O' characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones.
The game ends when there are three of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
No more moves can be played if the game is over.
Given a 2D integer array moves where moves[i] = [rowi, coli] indicates that the ith move will be played on grid[rowi][coli]. return the winner of the game if it exists (A or B). In case the game ends in a draw return "Draw". If there are still movements to play return "Pending".

You can assume that moves is valid (i.e., it follows the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe), the grid is initially empty, and A will play first.

<pre><code>Input: moves = [[0,0],[2,0],[1,1],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: "A"
Explanation: A wins, they always play first.


Example 2:

<p><img width="10%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamwine/Data-Structures-and-Algorithm/master/InterviewImages/1275_2.jpg" alt="1275_2.jpg"></p>

<pre><code>Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,2],[1,0],[2,0]]
Output: "B"
Explanation: B wins.


Example 3:

<p><img width="10%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamwine/Data-Structures-and-Algorithm/master/InterviewImages/1275_3.jpg" alt="1275_3.jpg"></p>

<pre><code>Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[0,1],[0,2],[2,2]]
Output: "Draw"
Explanation: The game ends in a draw since there are no moves to make.


Constraints:
1 &lt;= moves.length &lt;= 9
moves[i].length == 2
0 &lt;= rowi, coli &lt;= 2
There are no repeated elements on moves.
moves follow the rules of tic tac toe.
